# AI_ML_Lab

This repository is part of a course activity assigned by Prof. Dr. Yerriswami for evaluating key concepts in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**. It contains practical implementations of core ML algorithms and techniques using Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## üéØ Objective

The goal of this lab activity is to:

- Implement and understand fundamental ML algorithms.
- Compare different models on real-world datasets.
- Develop hands-on experience using popular Python libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.
